## What is CivicNet?

CivicNet is an open source platform designed to power **principle-aligned, AI-enabled civic infrastructure** for cities, nonprofits, governments, researchers, and communities.  
It is a “digital nervous system” for ethical and transparent civic technology: a modular set of tools, APIs, UIs, and standards for building, running, and governing digital public goods.

> CivicNet enables participatory democracy, ethical AI, and public trust by putting **civic principles**—like equity, transparency, and inclusion—at the heart of its architecture.

---

## Vision & Principles

**Vision:**  
To democratize access to trustworthy, explainable, and equitable civic technology, creating a new foundation for digital public service and community empowerment.

**Core Principles:**  
- **Equity & Inclusion:** Every feature considers all users, prioritizing accessibility and marginalized communities.
- **Transparency:** All algorithms, data sources, and AI model choices are documented, inspectable, and auditable.
- **Accountability:** All changes are logged, all prompts traceable, all governance visible.
- **Participation:** Public feedback, open governance, and collaborative design are default, not optional.
- **Security & Privacy:** Adherence to best practices and data protection laws.
- **Adaptability:** Modular design allows for customization, federation, and local control.

Read our [Principle Repository](docs/principle-repo.md) for living documentation.

## Architecture Overview

CivicNet is designed as a **layered, modular, and cloud-agnostic system** supporting both self-hosting and hybrid cloud deployments.

**Key Layers:**
- **MCP Server:** Orchestrates principle-driven prompts, connects to LLMs, handles civic data, manages alignment and auditing.
- **Developer/Admin Tools:** GUIs and CLIs for configuring, monitoring, and testing CivicNet systems.
- **Client Applications:** Web/mobile UIs, chatbots, dashboards, voice and SMS endpoints, all built to be LLM-agnostic.
- **Shared Libraries:** Common schema, constants, and utilities (used across all services).
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform for cloud resources, Helm for Kubernetes, Docker Compose for local/dev.

**High-level flow:**
User → Client → MCP Server → (LLM + Civic Data + Principles) → Response → Client/User  
All interactions logged and aligned with principles.

	•	(Recommended) Python 3.10+ (if using some LLM adapters or data tools)

Getting started:

# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/civicnet/civicnet.git
cd civicnet

# 2. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your LLM keys, DB URLs, etc.

# 3. Start everything locally
docker-compose up --build

# 4. Access
# API server:    http://localhost:8080
# Frontend UI:   http://localhost:3000
# Tools (if separate): http://localhost:5173

# 5. Run tests (optional)
cd server && npm run test

For Kubernetes/Cloud: see infra/README.md

Core Components

MCP Server
	•	Principle Engine: Enforces civic alignment by referencing the principle repository on every prompt/response.
	•	Prompt Orchestrator: Builds principle-enriched prompts; supports chain-of-thought, self-reflection, scenario simulation, and more.
	•	LLM Interface: Plug in OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face, or local models. Fully LLM-agnostic.
	•	Civic Data Adapter: Connect to city open data portals (Socrata, CKAN), government CMS, or local datasets.
	•	Alignment Checker: Post-process LLM output for bias, hallucination, or ethical violations.
	•	Audit Logging: Every request, prompt, and alignment decision logged for transparency.
	•	API: RESTful and (optionally) GraphQL endpoints for all clients.

See docs/server.md for full setup and config.

⸻

Developer/Admin Tools
	•	Principle Manager: GUI to review, add, or update civic principles (YAML/JSON backed).
	•	Prompt Template Builder: Visual tool for building multi-mechanism prompts and scenarios.
	•	Scenario Tester: CLI/GUI to test LLM responses against principle-aligned benchmarks.
	•	Log Viewer / Alignment Dashboard: Browse all prompt/output logs; view audit trail and alignment scores.

See docs/tools.md for features and usage.

⸻

Client Applications
	•	Web UI: Modern React (ShadCN, Tailwind), role-based access, i18n, mobile responsive. Connects via REST API.
	•	Mobile / SMS: Optional; designed to work for low-bandwidth or accessibility use cases.
	•	Civic Assistant: Public-facing chatbots or guided flows for town halls, community engagement, feedback, etc.
	•	Dashboards: Customizable for agencies, partners, community members; supports participatory budgeting, reporting, and analytics.

See docs/clients.md for setup, config, and deployment.

⸻

Shared Libraries
	•	Schemas: OpenAPI, JSON Schema for data and prompt payloads.
	•	Principle Templates: YAML/JSON docs, version controlled.
	•	Prompt Mechanisms: Chain-of-thought, reflection, simulation, recursion, and more.

⸻

Infrastructure as Code
	•	Terraform: For provisioning cloud databases, buckets, VMs, etc. (works with AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.)
	•	Helm Charts: For Kubernetes cluster deployment; fully configurable for multi-tenant or local setups.
	•	Docker Compose: For fast local spins or CI test runs.
	•	GitHub Actions: Auto linting, testing, deploy, and secrets handling.

See infra/README.md for scripts, variables, and examples.

⸻

Data & Privacy
	•	All sensitive user data is stored encrypted (at rest and in transit).
	•	No default telemetry or data exfiltration.
	•	Supports anonymization and GDPR/CCPA compliance modes.
	•	Audit logs redact PII by default; admins can opt-in to full trace for regulated environments.
	•	CivicNet does not monetize data—ever.

See docs/privacy.md for more.

⸻

DevOps & Deployment
	•	Local: docker-compose up spins all services.
	•	Staging/Prod: Use Helm/Terraform to deploy to your cloud or on-prem.
	•	CI/CD: GitHub Actions automatically run tests, build containers, push to registry, and (if configured) auto-deploy to a target cluster.
	•	Secrets: Use .env and GitHub Secrets; see infra/secrets.md.
	•	Scaling: MCP server is stateless and horizontally scalable; use load balancers as needed.
	•	Monitoring: Integrate with Prometheus, Grafana, or your preferred monitoring stack.
	•	Backup: Daily DB backup scripts provided.

⸻

Prompt Engineering & Principle Repository

Prompt system supports:
	•	Templates for each principle, scenario, and user role.
	•	Mechanisms: deconstruction, recursion, simulation, self-audit.
	•	Automatic injection of relevant civic data (e.g. local laws, budgets, recent feedback).
	•	Alignment checkers for ethical and factual compliance.
	•	Red-teaming and scenario benchmarking for community audits.

See docs/prompt-engineering.md and docs/principle-repo.md.

⸻

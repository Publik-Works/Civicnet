# 🏛️ CivicNet – A Principle-Centered AI Framework for Civic Engagement

**CivicNet** is an open source, principle-driven civic infrastructure framework built to support transparent, ethical, and participatory AI systems in government and community engagement.

---

## 🌐 What is CivicNet?

CivicNet is a modular Civic AI infrastructure system combining server orchestration, development tools, and public-facing client applications. It enables cities, civic tech teams, and researchers to build Local Language Model (LLM)-integrated solutions grounded in **civic principles**, transparent prompt engineering, and real-time feedback.

This project is the foundation for a new workforce of **Civic AI Engineers**, using the **Civic Principle Prompt Engineering System (CPPES)** to align AI with public values.

🧭 Civic Principles & Alignment

CivicNet uses an encoded Principle Repository that defines ethical, operational, and participatory values. All prompts and responses are filtered through:
	•	Natural language rules
	•	Role-based simulations
	•	Post-generation audits
	•	User feedback loops

🧪 Example Use Case

🗣️ A resident asks: “How can I influence local housing policy?”

	1.	Civic Assistant (Client) receives the question.
	2.	Prompt Engine combines civic principles + live city data.
	3.	LLM generates a principle-aligned response.
	4.	Alignment Checker validates tone, accuracy, fairness.
	5.	Response delivered with optional audit trail.
	6.	Feedback logged to improve future outputs.
